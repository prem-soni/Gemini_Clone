 # Gemini Clone - Built with React, Vite, and the Gemini Chat API This project is a simplified clone of the Gemini chat interface, built as a learning exercise and demonstration of integrating the Google Gemini Chat API into a modern web application. ## Technologies Used
React: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We use React's component-based architecture for a maintainable and scalable codebase.
Vite: A blazing-fast build tool that provides an excellent development experience. Vite enables rapid prototyping and efficient builds.
JavaScript: The primary programming language for implementing application logic and interacting with the Gemini Chat API.
CSS: Used for styling the application and creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Gemini Chat API: The core component enabling the chatbot functionality. This API allows us to send user prompts and receive responses from the Gemini AI model. ## About This Project This project serves as a demonstration of:
Front-end Development with React and Vite: Showcasing how to set up a modern React application using Vite for a fast and efficient development workflow.
API Integration: Demonstrating how to communicate with the Google Gemini Chat API to send user inputs and retrieve responses.
Basic Chat Interface: Implementing a basic chat interface with input fields, response display, and clear interactions between the user and the chatbot. 
Chat Input: A text input area where users can type their messages.
Response Display: A section for displaying the responses received from the Gemini model.
Basic Chat History: A way to keep track of past conversations.
Loading State:  Visual indication while the API processes the request and loads the response.
